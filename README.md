# BidirectionalCommunication
This project demonstrates how to transmit and receive data between two Arduino controllers using serial communication. It includes both the transmitter and receiver code, enabling seamless data exchange between the two devices. The project is designed for easy implementation and can be adapted for various applications requiring wireless or wired communication between Arduino systems.
